## Team 3: Covid-19 Case Study
This is the presentation and code that goes along with a case study done during the Fields Institute Forecasting for Decision-Making shortcourse in summer 2023. Team members include Danielle Berger, Gabriel Dansereau, Rhiannon Loster & Keara Smith. The purpose of this Covid-19 case study was to work on editting a base model with the given data, while hopefully answering the given "decision maker's request". The base model in this case was given as an SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) compartmental model, and the data was Covid-19 cases from the end of January to the end of March 2020 in British Columbia, CA. The decision maker's request was whether or not to implement masks within British Columbia, by making projections for the next 30 days (April 2020). The data used and code modified (using both R and STAN files) for this case study are available, as well as a pdf file of the presentation given on July 28, 2023.

## Getting Started
The attached code uses both DOCKER, if DOCKER is not already installed follow the instructions seen within the README file found here; https://github.com/kbbodner/cefi_shortcourse_students_2023/blob/main/CaseStudy_Covid19/covidseir/README.md
Once this is running open the "introduction_stan_seir_case_study.Qmd" to begin running the model.
